The BLE Mcicro is a low cost ARM cortex-m0 based module for Bluetooth® Smart designs with the nRF51822 SoC. The module gives access to at most 23 GPIO pins via pin pads and incorporates an on board PCB antenna to minimize material cost but also with a good performance.The application engineers can easily apply the module for theirs application without worrying about the specific impedance matching or soldering fine pitch related radio designing issues.

##   Over-The-Air
---
There are two batches of BLE Micro modules, one with Nordic S110 SoftDevice 6.0 and "DfuTarg" BLE device name, one with S110 SoftDevice 7.0 and "SD7DFU" BLE device name.
The BLE Micro has a pre-flashed OTA bootloader. To enter OTA mode:

1.  connect p18 of the BLE Micro to GND

2.  power on the BLE Micro

3.  a BLE device named DfuTarg (with SoftDevice 6.0) or SD7DFU (with SoftDevice 7.0) can be scaned

4.  use [nRF Master Control Panel](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.nordicsemi.android.mcp) to upgrade the BLE app

##   Download &amp; Debug through SWD interface
---
We can download and debug new application of BLE Micro with an [Arch BLE](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Arch-BLE-p-1998.html) or a J-Link through SWD interface. The Arch BLE is a BLE Micro + a CMSIS DAP interface which provides features like drag-n-drop programming, debug and USB virtual serial port communication.

##   Develop Applications
---
Go to [Seeedstudio mbed BLE project](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/mbed_ble) (or [SoftDevice 6.0 branch](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/mbed_ble/tree/softdevice_v6) to start developing. After you get your custom application hex file, use OTA to upgrade your BLE Micro.

If you are familiar with the Docker, there is [a Docker container](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/skyplabs/ble-micro/) created by Paul for you to setup toolchain quickly. You can use [the Dockerfile](https://github.com/SkypLabs/ble_micro_dockerfile) to get started.

If you have an [Arch BLE](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Arch-BLE-p-1998.html), you can also use [ARM mbed cloud-based IDE](https://developer.mbed.org/compiler/). See also [Arch BLE wiki](/Arch_BLE)

##   BLE UART
---
By default, the BLE Micro is acted as a BLE to UART device. It can be connected to Android or iOS.

*   BLE Device Name: nRF UART

*   UART RX: p7

*   UART TX: p8

*   UART Baud: 38400

*   Android App: [nRF UART on Goole Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nordicsemi.nrfUARTv2&amp;hl=en)
